We are trying to look for a MST in the house and wells graph and we also need to build it.
So Kruskal's algorithm works here and we will utilize path compression and union find operation.
We build the graph first and sort it because we will start with the edge with minimum weight.
While the edge formed is less than the total amount of vertices - 1, we do the following:
if the edge is united and doesn't form a cycle, we add the cost to the total and we increment edge processed.
when we are done we return the total.
