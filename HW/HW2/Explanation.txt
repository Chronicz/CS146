We have an array and we want to find the first bad version element in the array where [1,2,3,4 ... b,b,b,b,b,b... n-1]
So we could do linear search or binary search
Linear search would be a brute force for loop until found the first bad version element which has the time complexity of O(n)
Binary Search is more efficient and we just take the middle of the current search range and see if its a bad version
if its not, the first bad element is on the right side of the middle
else it is on the left side
Time complexity will be O(logn)
