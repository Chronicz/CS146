We have an array of chars which end up to have the same amount of chars in each string
so we could either brute force sort and compare it or we could use a hash table
we hash each char into the hash table increase the count of each unique char
then we decrease the count of unique char by the second anagram 
if the count is not = 0, either of them has more or less unique char count than the other
